1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,030
* Going out tonight, I'm feeling all right

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
* Going to let it all hang out

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,770
* Wanna make some noise, even raise my voice

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,680
* Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,140
Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,860
No.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,100
Why not?

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,490
Penny, while I subscribe to the "Many Worlds" theory

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,090
which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,270
in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,740
Are you fun in any of them?

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,210 
The math would suggest that in a few I'm a clown made of candy.

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,240
But I don't dance.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,070
Alright, want some French toast?

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,400
It's oatmeal day.

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,890
Tell you what, next French toast day, I'll make you oatmeal.

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,060
Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French toast day?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
Morning.

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,020
Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,400
Sorry, I haven't given her your schedule yet.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,750
It's an iCal download. She can put it right in her phone.

22
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,350
And I thought we agreed that you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,250
We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,610
I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,430
No, her bed kind of... broke.

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,930
That doesn't seem likely.

27
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,230
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,240
Even the addition of a second normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure,

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,200
much less a homunculus such as yourself.

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,590
A homunculus?

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,470
Perfectly formed miniature human being.

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,260
Oh, you're my little homunculus.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,060
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,960
Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?

35
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,050
I want oatmeal.

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,330
Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose room-mate isn't a giant pain in the ass.

37
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,410
I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

38
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,980
But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.

39
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,620
You know what, I give up. He's impossible.

40
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,540
I can't be impossible, I exist.

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,720
I believe what you meant to say is, "I gIve up, he's improbable."

42
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,690
Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,300
What am I supposed to do--eat French toast on a Monday?

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,710
Now, that would be impossible.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,750
I'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,860
You can catch even more flies with manure.  What's your point?

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,420
It's a...

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,620
Boy, that does smell good.

49
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,760
Too bad it's Monday.

53
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,190
Okay, Kim the night manager went on maternity leave,

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,170
and her husband's name is Sandy, right?

55
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,790
So get this-- her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,310
I know. What are the odds?

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,950
Easily calculable. We begin by identifying a set of married couples with unisex names.

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,060
We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work--

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,980
the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example look at...

60
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,330
Sheldon-- it's an amazing coincidence. Can we leave it at that?

61
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,340
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,490
Ooh, Penny, it's just if The Cheese Cake Factory is run by witches.

63
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,860
Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.

64
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,190
Come on, you guys, let it go.

65
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,150
Fine, whatever.

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,220
Are you finished?

67
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,910
Well, thank you. How thoughtful.

68
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,470
Would you like a chocolate?

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,970
Um, yeah, sure.

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,500
Thanks.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,800
What was that?

72
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,050
You said be nice to Penny.

73
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,850
I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.

74
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,210
It does. But in my experience, you don't.

75
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,030
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

76
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,990
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

77
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,390
Now that's you, obnoxious and insufferable.

78
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,030
What's going on, day dwellers?

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,250
Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"?

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,190
No. Raj and I are going to a Goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people.

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,070
Anybody want to come along?

82
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,500
Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?

83
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,240
No, no. I'm going out like this...

84
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,120
Howard, what did you do?

85
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,800
They're called tattoo sleeves. Look.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,670
I got them online. Raj got a set, too.

87
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,260
Fantastic, right?

88
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,340
Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced,

89
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,620
take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.

90
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,060
You know, I've always wanted to go to a Goth nightclub.

91
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,210
- Really?
- Bazinga!

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,450
None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?

93
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,110
Okay, how about you two? Look, I've got some extra tat sleeves.

94
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,340
Why are you carrying extras?

95
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,240
In case I snag one on someone's nipple ring.

96
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,710
Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.

97
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,550
Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?

98
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,190
In this case, you bet she is.

99
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes, she's pushy, and yes, he's whipped, but that's not the expression.

100
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,640
Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.

101
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,260
They're gonna get beaten up at that club.

102
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,930
They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens.

103
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,010
Oh, sorry, Sheldon. I almost sat in your spot.

104
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,630
Did you? I didn't notice. Have a chocolate.

105
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,440
Thank you.

106
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,750
I think we're fitting in quite nicely.

107
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,960
It'd help if you weren't drinking light beer.

108
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,080
What's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?

109
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,780
Hello? It looks like blood.

110
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,140
Did you even read the "Wiki how" link I sent you on being Goth?

111
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,770
No, I'm behind on my Wiki-reading.

112
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,510
I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.

113
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,730
What?

114
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,400
I finished reading the Pelican Brief

115
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,240
And loved it so much, I dived right into The Client.

116
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,880
He was a lawyer himself, so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.

117
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,540
Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.

118
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,530
Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it.

119
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,570
Can you pass the chex mix, please?

120
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,990
Thank you.

121
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,480
We are lost boys.

122
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,820
Good for you.

123
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm actually much more lost than he is.

124
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,010
- Nice ink.
- Thanks.

125
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,940
Can we buy you ladies a drink?

126
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,580
Two light beers.

127
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,570
Light beers. Well, Wiki-how about that.

128
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,710
- What's your names?
- I'm Howard.

129
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,390
- Raj.  I'm Bethany.

130
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,580
Nice to meet you, Bethany.

131
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,120
Yes, very nice.

132
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,890
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I'm Sarah. Not that anyone cares.

133
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,240
Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?

134
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,970
What's this cartoon called again?

135
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,880
Demon samurai.

136
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,930
It's not a cartoon. It's anime.

137
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,810
Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May.

138
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,400
Anna May Fletcher.

139
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,190
She was born with one nostril.

140
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,980
Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.

141
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,680
You're here a lot now.

142
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,920
Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.

143
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,070
Thank you. Chocolate?

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,880
Yes, please.

145
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,090
Hey, Kim. Yeah, I...

146
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,120
You know what, hold on. Let me take this in the hall.

147
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,470
You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work.

148
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,650
Okay, I know what you're doing.

149
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,720
Really?

150
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,080
Yes, you're using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.

151
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,210
Very good.

152
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,680
- Chocolate?
- No, I don't want any chocolate!

153
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,450
Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat.

154
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,250
Actually, it turns out I can.

155
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,660
Well, you shouldn't.

156
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,310
There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard?

157
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,880
You weren't happy with my previous approach to dealing with her,

158
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,860
so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques,

159
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,320
building on the works of Thorndike and B F Skinner.

160
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,900
By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool,

161
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,810
balancing a beach ball on her nose.

162
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,290
No, this has to stop now.

163
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,090
I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool.

164
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,450
I thought the "bazinga" was implied.

165
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,660
We're just tweaking her personality.

166
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,230
- Sanding off the rough edges, if you will.
- No. You're not sanding Penny.

167
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,170
Are you saying that I am forbidden from applying a harmless,

168
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,440
scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?

169
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,650
Yes. You're forbidden.

170
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,720
Bad Leonard.

171
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,220
So, what do you guys do?

172
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,380
Oh, you know, Goth stuff. Goth magazines, Goth music.

173
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,420
Goth food.

174
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,860
What's Goth food?

175
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,890
Blackened salmon?

176
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,440
No, I meant what do you do for jobs?

177
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,670
- Oh, we're scientists.
- Yeah, you know, the Dark Sciences.

178
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,980
What are the Dark Sciences?

179
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,350
Well, I am an astrophysicist, and a lot of that takes place at night.

180
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,380
When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.

181
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,740
Oy vay.

182
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,390
That sounds really cool.

183
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,770
Does it? Okay. If you like space stuff,

184
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,380
I design components for the International Space Station, which is in space.

185
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,820
Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.

186
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,320
So, what do you gals do?

187
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,710
- I work at The Gap.
- really?

188
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,440
How about that? I've been to The Gap.

189
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,690
I've been there, as well.

190
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,870
I like your t-shirts with the little pocket.

191
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,950
I work there, too. Not that anyone cares.

192
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,590
You know, this place is boring.

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,380
Yeah, why don't we go somewhere else and have some fun?

194
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,790
- Okay.
- Sure, we like fun.

195
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,230
- We are fun people.
- Dark and fun.

196
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,350
Come on.  I know a place you'll really dig.

197
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,500
- Did you bring the black condoms?
- In my fanny pack.

198
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,520
Let's go.

199
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,350
Are you happy now?

200
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,880
Not particularly.

201
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,410
My God, she didn't!

202
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,910
What could she possibly be talking about for so long?

203
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,870
Obviously, waitressing at The Cheese Cake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity

204
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,500
that requires a great deal of analysis and planning.

205
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,900
"Bazinga. "

206
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,150
You know, using positive reinforcement techniques,

207
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,800
I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.

208
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,330
No.

209
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,930
If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.

210
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,160
You're not squirting her in the face with water.

211
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,150
No, of course not.

212
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,810
We're talking very mild electric shocks.

213
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,480
No tissue damage whatsoever.

214
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,090
Forget it.

215
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,670
Oh, come on. You can't tell me

216
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,400
that you're not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.

217
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,150
I'm not.

218
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,510
Well, and Penny's qualities, both good and bad, are what make her what she is.

219
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,210
You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?

220
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,480
Yes.

221
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,450
You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?

222
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,830
You're not changing how Penny laughs.

223
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,400
No, that would be incongruous.

224
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,690
I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.

225
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,550
Sorry, guys. That girl is freaky.

226
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,280
Come again?

227
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,540
- Freaky.
- Freaky?

228
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,010
Yeah, freaky.

229
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,390
Have a chocolate.

230
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,670
Thank you.

231
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,530
Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex

232
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,840
With a strange girl you met in a bar?

233
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,170
Yeah!

234
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,970
What is your mother going to say?

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,640
She's not going to see it.

236
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,560
She takes my temperature orally now.

237
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,940
What are you going to get, Howard?

238
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,260
Well, I can't really decide between a screaming devil,

239
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,880
this mean little skull, or Kermit the frog.

240
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,630
- Kermit the frog?
- You know. I'm on Howard's butt.

241
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,610
Get the mean little skull, and I'll see if I can make him smile.

242
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,310
Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.

243
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,310
What are you going to get, Raj?

244
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,940
With my luck, hepatitis.

245
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,340
Okay, here we go.

246
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,550
That's just rubbing alcohol.

247
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,930
I know, but it was cold.

248
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,420
I'm putting on the stencil.

249
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,310
What comes after the stencil?

250
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,260
This.

251
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,580
Okay, that's it. No needle. No pain. No tattoo.

252
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,560
What's the big deal? You've done this before.

253
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,650
No, I haven't. Look.

254
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm sorry. I'm a fraud. He's a fraud.

255
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,000
We're both frauds.

256
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,870
- Yeah, I think I covered that.
- But I was summing up.

257
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,780
We're not Goth.

258
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,170
We're just... guys.

259
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,350
Very, very smart guys.

260
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,590
- So you were totally scamming us?
- Yes.

261
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,040
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again.

262
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,770
Unless, of course, our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive, huh? Anything?

263
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm leaving.

264
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,440
I'm leaving, too. Not that anyone cares.

265
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,550
When we tell this story, let's end it differently.

266
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,520
What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?

267
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,690
Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in.

268
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,790
I trust if you two are planning on engaging in amorous activities,

269
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,220
you'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.

270
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,850
- Of course.
- Thank you.

271
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,120
These are so good.

272
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,170
Unbelievable.

273
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,720
What?

274
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,360
I-I was just thinking we should probably turn in, too.

275
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,610
Well, you know, my new bed got delivered.

276
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,360
If you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.

277
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,640
Really? That's a lot of work, and it's kind of late.

278
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,000
- Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have to be quiet.
- Let's go.

279
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,120
Interesting.

280
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,300
Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour.

281
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,850
I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.

282
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,660
Okay, wait.  How about this?

283
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,110
We say there were four Goth girls.

284
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,480
The two girls in the club had two friends.

285
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,330
I like it, I like it.

286
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,850
Did they smell good despite their Goth-like nature?

287
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,250
What's that got to do with the story?

288
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,090
Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.

289
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,470
Fine, they smelled good.

290
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,180
Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle

291
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,060
Whatever.

292
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,600
And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic, hokey pokey for us.

293
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,560
No, no. Look, let me just say my story all the way through

294
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,190
And then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.

295
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,530
- I'm sorry. Go on.
- Okay.

296
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,020
We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.

297
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,260
But we don't have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?

298
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,450
We say they're in a very intimate area.

299
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,080
Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?

300
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,930
Right, right.

301
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,080
So, we go back to their place and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.

302
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,870
But we just got tattoos. Wouldn't we be concerned about bacterial infection?

303
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,240
True. Okay. Forget the hot tub.

304
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,290
The point is, we each had a menage with sexy Goth girls.

305
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,330
What a great night.

306
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,960
Yeah.

307
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,970
Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night?

308
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,910
Maybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.

309
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,620
Could happen.

310
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,060
I wonder how they smell.
