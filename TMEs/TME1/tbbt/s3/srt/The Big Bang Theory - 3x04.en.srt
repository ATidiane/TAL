1
00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:06,794
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

2
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:08,306
What do you mean?

3
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:09,960
The instructions are very clear:

4
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:11,817
"don't feed the gremlins
after midnight. "

5
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:15,369
"don't get the gremlins wet. "

6
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:19,391
How hard is that?

7
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:21,770
(door opening)

8
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:23,064
Hi, guys.

9
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:24,136
Hi, honey.

10
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:25,031
Hey.

11
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,372
Ooh, we're "honey" now, are we?

12
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:29,083
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal,

13
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:31,606
Penny has upgraded his
designated term of endearment,

14
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:34,421
Thus distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie,"

15
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:37,180
Usually in an attempt to soften
a thinly-veiled insult.

16
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:40,547
You're boring people,
sweetie.

17
00:00:42,297 --> 00:00:44,704
Although, sometimes,
she omits the veil entirely.

18
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:47,472
So, what are
you guys doing?

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,177
Celebrating
Columbus day.

20
00:00:49,248 --> 00:00:51,542
<i>We're watching goonies, gremlins
and young sherlock holmes. </i>

21
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,746
They're all written
by Chris Columbus.

22
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:57,660
Okay.

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,588
What do you watch
on thanksgiving?

24
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,009
The parade.

25
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,212
Oh, you know,
that reminds me...

26
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:05,939
I usually go back to
Nebraska for thanksgiving,

27
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:07,251
But this year they're
calling it off

28
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:08,922
On account of my
brother's trial.

29
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:11,037
What's he on trial for?

30
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,918
Oh, just a big
misunderstanding.

31
00:01:12,987 --> 00:01:14,547
You know, you'd actually
like my brother.

32
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:15,964
He's kind of
a chemist.

33
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,997
Anyway, I was thinking
I'd have thanksgiving here,

34
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:22,456
And you are all invited.

35
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:23,820
Oh. I'll be there.

36
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:25,604
Will you be serving
cranberry jelly

37
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:27,167
Or cranberry sauce?

38
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,643
I guess I could
serve both.

39
00:01:29,737 --> 00:01:32,514
You guess? I don't seem to
have much of a handle on this.

40
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,251
Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year,

41
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:39,796
My mother has all the
relatives over and cooks up

42
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:41,508
Her famous tur-briska-fil.

43
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,448
Tur-briska-fil?

44
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:47,256
Turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

45
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,505
It's not as good as it sounds.

46
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:54,526
Raj, what about you?

47
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,703
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

48
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:02,866
All right, this year,
you don't have to

49
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:04,663
Eat the
tur-briska-fil.

50
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:06,571
(chuckles)

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,730
I don't even chew it.

52
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:09,091
I swallow it like pills.

53
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:38,803
So, what's going on
with Raj?

54
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,765
Well, the good news is,

55
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:43,228
He has no problem
with my mother's tur-bruska-fil.

56
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,984
Hard to believe,
but go on.

57
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:49,996
The bad news is,
he says he's getting deported.

58
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:51,134
<i>Leonard:</i>
What do you mean,

59
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,164
He's getting deported?

60
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:53,496
I believe it means
that the U.S. Government

61
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:55,178
Is going to expel him
from the country.

62
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:57,671
He could then either return
to his native India,

63
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:00,083
Emigrate to another country
that's willing to accept him

64
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,735
Or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

65
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:07,905
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

66
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:11,785
Penny, would you mind
stepping outside

67
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:13,104
So we can speak to him?

68
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,922
(groans)
fine.

69
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,654
But the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.

70
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,978
Another reason to consider a
life of piracy.

71
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:22,408
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

72
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:26,648
Okay, she's gone.

73
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:33,725
Sorry.
I lost my cool.

74
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,035
So, what's going on?

75
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,725
Okay, here's the deal:

76
00:03:38,832 --> 00:03:40,830
Six months ago, my
research testing

77
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:43,434
The predicted composition
of trans-neptunian objects

78
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,079
Ran into a dead end.

79
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,150
So?
So, my visa's only good as long as

80
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,375
I'm employed at the university.
And when they find out at I've got squat,

81
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:51,579
They're going to cut me off.

82
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,723
By the way, when I say squat,
I mean diddly-squat.

83
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,191
I wish I had squat.

84
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,332
So, wait, what have you been
doing for the past six months?

85
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,275
You know, checking e-mail,

86
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:06,658
Updating my facebook status,

87
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:09,264
Messing up wikipedia entries.

88
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:12,875
Hey, did you know netflix

89
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,414
Lets you stream movies
on your computer now?

90
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,131
And you've continued
to take the University's money

91
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,740
Under false pretenses?

92
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,907
Highly unethical
for an astrophysicist.

93
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,304
Although practically mandatory
for a pirate.

94
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,212
I don't want to go back
to India.

95
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:30,846
It's hot and loud,
and there's so many people.

96
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:34,776
You have no idea...
they're everywhere.

97
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,112
Okay, guys, think.

98
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,690
How do we keep Raj
in the country?

99
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,910
<i>Penny:</i>
Why doesn't he just get another job?

100
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,414
What are you
asking me for?

101
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:56,599
I don't know if you
can talk now or not.

102
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:03,207
Oh, beef...

103
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:05,104
I'm going to miss
you so much.

104
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:08,346
Do you know,
at the mumbai mcdonald's,

105
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,828
You can't get a big mac?

106
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:12,097
All you can get
is a chicken maharaja mac.

107
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,303
And the special sauce...

108
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,498
Curry... which, in india,
believe you me,

109
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:17,854
Is really not that special.

110
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,545
Don't worry,
you'll find another job.

111
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,313
Yeah let me start
practicing for it.

112
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:25,271
"do you want fries with
that maharaja mac?"

113
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,305
<i>Sheldon:</i>
Hi, Leonard.

114
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,407
Hello, Raj.

115
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:30,869
Hello, Sheldon.

116
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:34,811
Forgive me, as you know, I'm no
adept at reading facial cues,

117
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,289
But I'm going
to take a stab here:

118
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,869
You're either sad or nauseated.

119
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:41,293
I'm sad.

120
00:05:41,352 --> 00:05:42,408
I was going to say sad.

121
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,784
I don't know why I hedged.

122
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:46,763
What are you eating?

123
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,861
Elbow macaroni with ground
hamburger and tomato sauce.

124
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,812
Oh, beefaroni.

125
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,115
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

126
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,093
I've always been
a little confused about this.

127
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,779
Why don't hindus eat beef?

128
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,221
We believe cows are gods.

129
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,188
Not technically.

130
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:03,626
<i>In hinduism, cattle are
thought to be like god. </i>

131
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,963
Do not tell me about
my own culture, Sheldon!

132
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,205
In the mood I'm in, I'll take
you out... I swear to cow!

133
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,378
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:13,789
Me, too.

135
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:15,245
I'm just...
I'm a little on edge.

136
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,030
Understandable.

137
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,303
Your entire life seems
to be crumbling around you,

And your future
appears bleak at best.

Thank you.

140
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,326
And you're wrong
about hinduism and cows.

00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:27,589
Hey, Raj, guess what.

142
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:29,110
Professor Laughlin
is looking for someone to join

143
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:30,806
The stellar evolution
research team.

144
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,323
You-you're kidding! That's fantastic! I know! What
are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.

145
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,249
I'm on it.

146
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:37,858
That's happy, right?

147
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:38,910
Yeah.
Nailed it.

148
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:43,211
Dr. Koothrappali, come on in.

149
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,012
I was surprised to hear
you were interested

150
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,442
In joining our little team.

151
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,059
Giving up on those
trans-neptunian objects, are we?

152
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:51,023
No, no; it's a very
promising area.

153
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,609
In a perfect world I'd spend several
more years on it.

154
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,290
But I just couldn't pass up
the opportunity

155
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,521
To work with you
on your tremendously exciting

156
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:00,154
And not yet conclusively
disproved hypothesis.

157
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:01,920
Splendid.

158
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,336
Uh, please sit down.

159
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,994
Can I offer you
a sherry?

160
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,659
It's a little
early, isn't it?

161
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,499
Not on proxima centauri.

162
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:09,614
(chuckles)

163
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:10,817
(laughing):
That's very good.

164
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:13,031
Jolly amusing,
but if you don't mind,

165
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:15,312
I'll hold off
until sunset on titan.

166
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:17,242
(laughs)
well done.

167
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:18,554
I have a feeling you're going

168
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,205
To fit in just fine,
Dr. Koothrappali.

169
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,357
Thank you, sir.

170
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:22,552
(knock at door)

171
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:24,091
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:25,291
Am I late?

173
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:26,430
No, no, no.
Right on time.

174
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,147
Dr. Koothrappali,
may I present

175
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,037
Dr. Millstone from MIT.

176
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:32,275
She'll be heading up
our data analysis team.

177
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,404
It's nice to meet you,
Dr. Koothrappali.

178
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:38,745
I read your paper on kuiper belt
object size distribution.

179
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,714
I really enjoyed it.

180
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:47,194
How did you correct
for the selection bias?

181
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:50,888
Well, I ran a simulation
that allowed me

182
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:53,118
To correct for the
observational efficiency.

183
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:55,160
That's just fascinating.

184
00:07:55,485 --> 00:07:56,335
Thank you.

185
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:01,064
Would you like to hear
more about it in my hot tub?

186
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:06,888
So, when do I start?

187
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,592
What do you mean you
didn't get the job?

188
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:13,742
How could you
not get it?

189
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:17,879
You know... He's british;
I'm indian.

190
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:21,095
Ever since Gandhi,
they haven't liked us very much.

191
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,867
Wait, are you saying that
he discriminated against you?

192
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:26,318
Because we should
file a complaint.

193
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:27,387
That's okay.

194
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:28,976
A complaint has been filed.

195
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:32,162
So, that's it.

196
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:33,847
That was my last hope.

197
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,361
I'm going
to be deported,

198
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:37,063
Sent home in disgrace,

199
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:40,303
Exposed to the sardonic barb
of my cousin sanjay.

200
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:42,864
Or, as you may know him,
dave from at&t customer service.

201
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,142
I'm really going
to miss you.

202
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,974
Will you come visit me
in India?

203
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,198
Gee, that's, like,
a 17-hour flight.

204
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,695
How about I meet
you halfway?

205
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,951
Halfway is 600 miles
off the coast of japan.

206
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,502
Tell you what,
we'll skype.

207
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:08,456
Gentlemen.

208
00:09:08,524 --> 00:09:09,719
<i>Leonard:</i>
Hey, Raj,

209
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,681
Did you get the job
with professor laughlin?

210
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:13,608
No.
I assumed as much.

211
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:14,690
But never fear.

212
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,320
Like the subordinate
male protagonist

213
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:17,787
In countless action movies

214
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:19,969
Who disappears half way
through the second reel,

215
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:21,952
I have returned to save the day.

216
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,671
Odd.

217
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,169
Usually, he's met by cheers.

218
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:29,915
Anyway,

219
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:31,109
I was thinking about exploring

220
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,533
The string theory implications

221
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:35,104
Of gamma rays from
dark matter annihilations,

222
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,602
And it occurred to me
that I could benefit...

223
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,528
Excuse me, Sheldon.

224
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:39,288
How many reels before
the subordine male protagonist

225
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,834
Gets to his point?

226
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:42,786
I'm sorry... if you didn't
cheer at my entrance,

227
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:44,222
It's too late
to buy into the premise.

228
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,252
Anyway, I got
some extra money

229
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:50,686
From the head of
the department,

230
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:53,006
And Raj can come
work for me.

231
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:55,435
<i>You want me
to work with you?</i>

232
00:09:56,327 --> 00:09:57,546
<i>For me. </i>

233
00:09:58,403 --> 00:09:59,577
You're going to
have to listen

234
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:01,133
More carefully when
you're on the job.

235
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,609
Ay, uh, please don't take this
the wrong way,

236
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,686
But I'd rather swim buck-naked
across the ganges

237
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:09,286
With a paper cut on my nipple

238
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:12,000
And die a slow,
agonizing death

239
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,449
From a viral infection
than work with you.

240
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:17,645
<i>For me. </i>

241
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:26,480
(knock at door)

242
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,508
Sheldon, are you busy?

243
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,562
Of course I'm busy.

244
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,538
Shall I wait?
Yes, please.

245
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:49,320
How may I help you?

246
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:53,755
I've reconsider your offer
to let me work with you.

247
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,482
<i>For me</i>

248
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:58,077
<i>Yes, for you. </i>

249
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:00,356
I do, however, have
a few conditions.

250
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,944
First, at all times,

251
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:04,071
I am to be treated
as a colleague and an equal.

252
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:06,018
Second, my contributions
shall be noted

253
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:07,225
In all published material.

254
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,401
And third, you are never allowed
to lecture me

255
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,332
On hinduism
or my indian culture.

256
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:14,575
I'm impressed, Raj.

257
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,018
Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.

258
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:18,259
Thank you.
I reject them all.

259
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:22,232
Then you leave me no choice.

260
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:23,872
I accept the job.

261
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,113
I'm sorry, I believe
you've misunderstood.

262
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,886
I'm not giving you the job.

263
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:33,083
I'm simply affording you
the opportunity to apply for it.

264
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:37,277
Have a seat; we'll get started
with the interview.

265
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,556
Wha... You're kidding!

266
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,231
Please.

267
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,118
(sighs)
all right.

268
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:46,490
(annoyed sigh)

269
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,239
So... (sighs)

270
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:53,204
That's what you wear
to an interview?

271
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,800
Come on, dude,
we've been friends for years.

272
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:59,017
Oh, pulling strings, are we?

273
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:03,298
Sheldon, for god's sakes,
don't make me beg.

274
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,435
Bazinga!

275
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:07,772
You've fallen victim

276
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:10,104
To another one
of my classic practical jokes.

277
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:14,972
I'm your boss now.
You may want to laugh at that.

278
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:22,206
Ah, nice having the
place to ourselves, isn't it?

279
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,333
Uh-huh.

280
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,001
Now that Raj is
working for Sheldon,

281
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,722
I don't have to chauffeur
him around anymore.

282
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:28,832
Plus, yeah, with them
working late so much,

283
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,291
We get some privacy.

284
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,419
Mm-hmm.

285
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:36,089
Hey, want to get a little crazy?

286
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:38,042
What are you thinking?

287
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,035
Let's slide over to
Sheldon's spot a make out.

288
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,159
You are a dirty girl.

289
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:49,701
(knocking on door)

290
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,176
Oh, god, how did he know?

291
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,360
Hello.

292
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,581
Hi, Howard.
(wry laugh)

293
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:56,977
Am I interrupting?

294
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:58,569
Little bit, yeah.

295
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:00,243
Guess I should have called.

296
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:01,608
Yeah, maybe.

297
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,928
(sighs)

298
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,926
(clicking tongue)

299
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,150
Tonight's the night
I usually go line dancing

300
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:13,873
With Raj at the Palomino.

301
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,549
Uh-huh.

302
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:18,761
But he's working with Sheldon.

303
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:20,053
Yes, we know.

304
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,337
Want me to leave?

305
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,553
You know, whatever.

306
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:27,292
Okay, I guess I can hang
for a little while.

307
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,231
So what are we watching?

308
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,773
<i>Sex and the city.
Yikes. </i>

309
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:36,764
Hey, I happen
to love this movie.

310
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,177
Fine, let's watch it.

311
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,494
Maybe all our periods
will synchronize.

312
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:48,236
All right, we're going to
be designing an experiment

313
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,101
To look
for the annihilation spectrum

314
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,334
Resulting from dark matter
collisions in space.

315
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,621
Ooh, dark matter.

316
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:56,242
We better bring
a flashlight.

317
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,865
(chuckles)

318
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:00,819
I was making a joke.

319
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,010
I'm the boss.

320
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:03,358
I make the jokes.

321
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,173
Sorry
go ahead and make your joke.

322
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,789
This is not the
time for joking.

323
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:11,615
We're doing
serious research,

324
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:13,479
Which requires complete
and utter focus.

325
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:15,801
All right,
let's buckle down and work.

326
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:18,325
("Eye of the tiger"
by Survivor playing)

327
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:47,869
Sheldon.
What?

328
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:48,992
I need an aspirin.

329
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,109
Top desk drawer.

330
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,674
Thank you.
Alright?

331
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,791
Yes.
Good.

332
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,210
("Eye of the tiger" resumes)

333
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:09,824
That was fun.

334
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,498
Thank you.

335
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,412
Leonard, honey, you don't
have to say thank you

336
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,804
Every time we have sex.

337
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:16,328
Oh. Okay.

338
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,341
Tomorrow you're going to
get a card in the mail.

339
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:20,660
Just throw it away.

340
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,571
(clattering)

341
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:26,099
(in irish brogue):
Top o' the mornin' to ya!

342
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,581
What are you doing here?

343
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:33,121
Well, usually, on Sundays,
I go with Raj

344
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,516
To scam on hippie chicks
at the farmers market,

345
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,496
But he's still working
with Sheldon,

346
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,776
So I thought I'd come over here

347
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,563
And make you guys
scrambled eggs and salami.

348
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,718
<i>It's the perfect meal
for après I'amour. </i>

349
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,210
Oh, kill me.

350
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:53,068
By the way, I couldn't help
overhearing your big finish.

351
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:54,644
Bravo, Leonard.

352
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,912
See, if you had killed me
when I said "kill me,"

353
00:15:59,982 --> 00:16:01,209
I wouldn't have had to
hear that. (stammers)

354
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,349
What do you guys think?

355
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:04,539
Want to take
in a matinee,

356
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:05,847
Maybe go
rollerblading,

357
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:06,957
Catch a step class?

358
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,678
Do something.

359
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,800
Okay.

360
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,241
Um, Howard, we
need to talk.

361
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,041
Sure. 'sup, Holmes?

362
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,437
Uh... Please understand

363
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:20,670
That it's not that we
don't want you around,

364
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:23,139
But Penny and I
occasionally need some...

365
00:16:24,504 --> 00:16:25,429
Alone time.

366
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:27,843
Oh.

367
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:32,254
I- I get it, I'm the third wheel.

368
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,245
(chuckles)

369
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,745
Sorry, I should have seen that.

370
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,138
I'll get out
of your way.

371
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,778
Uh, you're gonna want

372
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,497
To eat those eggs
while they're still hot.

373
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:42,706
Thank you.

374
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:47,321
There's lox and cream cheese
in the fridge.

375
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:49,835
The bagels are in the oven,
I was...  warming them up.

376
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:54,719
Great.

377
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,971
I'm just going to hang out
with my mom

378
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,300
That's always fun

379
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,110
Good.

380
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,849
Are we terrible people?

381
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:10,840
I don't know.

382
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:12,582
What do you
want me to do?

383
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:14,142
(stammers)

384
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:16,180
G- get him;
bring him back.

385
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,846
Are you sure?

386
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:20,610
Yeah.
Okay.

387
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:21,879
Howard come back.

388
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,768
Oh, you guys had me scared
for a minute.

389
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:28,872
No, no, no, no!

390
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:30,028
That rate is much too low

391
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,526
From what we'd expect
from this collision.

392
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:32,448
Do you understand

393
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:33,500
We're talking
about dark matter

394
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,272
Colliding in outer space?

395
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,663
Of course I understand.

396
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,888
<i>And who are you to tell me
about outer space?</i>

397
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,339
I'm the astrophysicist.

398
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:41,758
"astro" means "space. "

399
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,415
"astor" means "star. "

400
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,198
Okay, well, let
me just tell you,

401
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:48,491
If we were having
this argument

402
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:50,502
In my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.

403
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,808
<i>English is
your native language. </i>

404
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,460
Okay, you got me there, but
you're wrong about this!

405
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,950
There is a fine line
between wrong and visionary.

406
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,981
Unfortunately you have to be
a visionary to see it.

407
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:07,799
My god, you think
that every thought

408
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,694
That comes out of your
head is pure gold.

409
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:10,871
Well, let me tell
you something.

410
00:18:10,947 --> 00:18:12,557
Some of those thoughts
are pure caca.

411
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:13,622
Caca?!

412
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,505
It means "doo-doo."

413
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:16,850
All right!

414
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:18,876
First of all,
Dr. Koothrappali,

415
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:20,671
When I first proposed
that you work with me..

416
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,590
Aha! So I am
working with you.

417
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,973
In this context,
"with me" means "for me."

418
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:26,928
Ah, well, in
this context...

419
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,154
Oh!

420
00:18:30,052 --> 00:18:31,796
If I'm wrong,
prove it.

421
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:32,985
Okay.

422
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:36,792
Here's where we derive the mass
of the dark matter particle.

423
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:38,908
You've misstated the
atomic weight of the target.

424
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:40,402
Let me finish.
You're defacing work.

425
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,142
I'm not defacing it,
I'm fixing it.

426
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,898
Give me the eraser.
No.

427
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,455
I said give it to me.

428
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:47,141
Come and get it.

429
00:18:48,608 --> 00:18:49,875
Fine.

430
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,592
Oh, Lord.

431
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:58,074
Dr. Koothrappali,

432
00:18:58,147 --> 00:19:00,707
As your superior, I forbid you
from writing on my board!

433
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,166
You are not my superior.

434
00:19:02,256 --> 00:19:03,646
I am in every way.

435
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:04,642
Oh, yeah?

436
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:05,844
Can you do this?

437
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,118
Nice working with you.

438
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,300
<i>I'm sorry... for you. </i>

439
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:41,121
Raj...

440
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,732
Raj... Raj...

441
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:47,184
I'm busy.

442
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,347
Doing what?

443
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,382
All right,
you've made your point.

444
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,570
What do you want, Sheldon?

445
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:55,928
I looked over the board

446
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,464
And it turns out
you were right.

447
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,723
So you were wrong.
I didn't say that.

448
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,053
That's the only
logical inference.

449
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,491
Nevertheless,
I didn't say it.

450
00:20:04,094 --> 00:20:06,847
Anyway, I would like you to come
back and work for me.

451
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:08,978
<i>For you or with you?</i>

452
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:13,074
In this context "for me"
could mean "with me. "

453
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:14,705
All right, but I have
some conditions.

454
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:16,149
I reject them all.
I'll take the job.

455
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:19,323
See you Monday.

456
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:22,021
Wait, you have
to drive me home.

457
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:23,518
How did you get here?
I walked.

458
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:24,754
So walk home.
I can't.

459
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,456
There's a big dog outside.

460
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:33,488
On the way home,
we can start thinking

461
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:35,252
About methods
of optimizing the detector

462
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,305
For 500 gev particles.

463
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:38,482
All right.
