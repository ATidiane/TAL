1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,001
Sheldon, you're wrong.

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:06,008
Wolverine was not born
with bone claws.

3
00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:07,519
Howard, you know me to be
a very smart man.

4
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:11,528
Don't you think
if I were wrong, I'd know it?

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,541
Okay, first of all...
Give it up, dude.

6
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,049
You're arguing
with a crazy person.

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,559
I'm not crazy.

8
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:19,064
My mother had me tested.

9
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:22,577
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,585
What do you mean?
It's new comic book night.

11
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,593
Yeah, but since you and Penny
finally hooked up, we thought

12
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:30,101
you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-yum night.

13
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:33,115
There's more to life
than sex, Raj.

14
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:35,126
Okay, who had "Leonard
flames out with Penny

15
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:37,133
- in less than 24 hours"?
- I did.

16
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:39,143
Nothing flamed out.

17
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,149
We don't have to have sex
every night, you know.

18
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:45,159
You don't have to,
but it's highly recommended.

19
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:47,173
Yeah, take advantage
of that window of opportunity

20
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,684
before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

21
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:52,695
It's not a matter
of opportunity.

22
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,702
We're getting to know
each other.

23
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,708
There's a learning curve.

24
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:56,714
What's there to learn?

25
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:58,218
You get naked, do nasty
things to each other,

26
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:00,224
then somebody makes
scrambled eggs and salami.

27
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,231
Easy peasy.

28
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:02,736
Perhaps what Leonard

29
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,241
is obliquely referring to

30
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,749
is the occurrence of some sort
of sexual dysfunction.

31
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:10,259
Okay, who had
"Leonard gets a floppy disk"?

32
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,772
Oh, a clever--
albeit obsolete, euphemism

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,282
for insufficient blood flow
to the male sex organ.

34
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,792
(chuckles)

35
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,801
Nothing like that happened,
all right?

36
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,809
The sex was... just fine.

37
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,817
Just fine?

38
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:27,827
Oh, dude, the fourth Harry
Potter movie was "just fine."

39
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,842
I'm not saying it was bad.

40
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:32,850
I'm just saying it...
wasn't great.

41
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:33,859
Okay, when you say
"it wasn't great,"

42
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:34,863
do you mean for both of you?

43
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:36,870
Because we can totally see
it not being great for her.

44
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:38,878
Am I right?
Oh, yeah.

45
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,384
To tell you the truth,
I think we were both a little--

46
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,392
I don't know...

47
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,897
Disappointed? Let down?

48
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:45,904
Ashamed? Horrified?
Repulsed?

49
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,413
All I know is, it wasn't the wa
y I dreamed it would be.

50
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:53,928
(scoffs)
Sex is never the way
Idream it's gonna be.

51
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,953
Because in your dreams
you're a horse from the waist down.

52
00:01:59,965 --> 00:02:02,467
Excuse me,
Wolverine: Origin.

53
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,979
Miniseries issue two, page 22.

54
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:07,489
Retractable bone claws.

55
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,998
If you people spent less time
thinking about sex

56
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,006
and more time concentrating
on comic books,

57
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:14,014
we'd have far fewer of these
embarrassing moments.

58
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:20,033
# Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state #

59
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:23,546
# Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! #

60
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,059
# The Earth began to cool #

61
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:28,066
# The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools #

62
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,077
# We built the Wall #
# We built the pyramids #

63
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,087
# Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery #

64
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,596
# That all started
with a big bang #

65
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,602
# Bang! #

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,002
BBT S03E02 "Jiminy Conjecture"
by Mikhel

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,101
Sheldon, dinner's here.

68
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:44,106
SHELDON:
Tandoori Palace?

69
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:45,611
No, we went somewhere new.

70
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:51,625
You're good-naturedly
ribbing me, aren't you?

71
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,132
No, look, Mumbai Palace.

72
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:55,137
Why?

73
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:57,140
Why would we change?

74
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,646
We had a perfectly good palace.

75
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,651
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

76
00:03:01,656 --> 00:03:03,157
Trust me, this will be
just fine.

77
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,161
(scoffs)

78
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,163
You are the authority

79
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:08,168
on "just fine."
(snickering)

80
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,175
What's that supposed to mean?

81
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:12,180
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,186
"Not bad, but not great."

83
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:15,190
(stifled chuckles)

84
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,197
What are they talking about?

85
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,702
I don't know
I know.

86
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:20,705
As I'm sure
you're aware...
Duh-duh-duh-duh

87
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,710
duh-duh.

88
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:25,214
If that's Morse code,
that's terrible.

89
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,224
As I was saying,
you and Leonard had

90
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:29,728
sexual encounter. a disap
pointing

91
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,732
Earlier this evening,

92
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,735
Leonard characterized it
as "just fine."

93
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,241
So what you're seeing
here is a continuation

94
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:36,745
of the mocking that followed.

95
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,257
Okay, yeah, well,

96
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,261
I'm just gonna go
eat my dinner elsewhere.

97
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,266
Maybe an airplane
headed for a mountainside.

98
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:47,274
Penny, wait.

99
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:48,779
Aah!

100
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:51,283
What is wrong with you?

101
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:52,289
(door slams)

102
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:58,300
I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

103
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,809
Yeah, you...
No, don't tell him
.

104
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:03,816
Let's see if he can
figure it out.

105
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,335
Ugh, I am so embarrassed!

106
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,841
Please don't be mad.

107
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:12,844
What did you tell them?

108
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:15,848
Nothing bad, just that
last night was fine.

109
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:18,355
Fine? You said it was fine?

110
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,362
Yeah, it's a perfectly
good word.

111
00:04:20,365 --> 00:04:22,367
You put it in front
of "wine" or "dining,"

112
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,873
and you've really got something
.

113
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:30,888
Okay, well, let me ask you this:

114
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,895
How was last night for you?

115
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,402
It was... okay.

116
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,410
Okay?

117
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:40,916
Yeah, it's a perfectly
good word.

118
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,922
I mean, you put it
in front of "dokay"

119
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:44,927
and you really got something.

120
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:47,937
All right, look,
let's not overreact, you know?

121
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,440
For a lot of couples,
it takes time

122
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:50,944
to get to know
each other's rhythms.

123
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,949
Learn what the other person
wants and likes.

124
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:54,954
So, you've been
through this before?

125
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:56,458
No.

126
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,967
Okay-dokay.

127
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,977
You know, I think this is
one of those things where

128
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,482
talking about it is not
going to make it better.

129
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,486
Want a glass of wine?

130
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:08,991
So much.
Okay.

131
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:10,997
See, we should've
done this last night.

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,003
You know, have a little wine,
take the edge off.

133
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,510
Actually, ethyl alcohol
inhibits electrical conduction

134
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:19,517
in the nerve cells and
stimulates reuptake receptors

135
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:24,527
of inhibitory neurotransmitters
like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

136
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,545
Don't talk, just drink.

137
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:33,557
No, you're misunderstanding

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,064
A shiksa goddess
isn't an actual goddess

139
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,571
And we don't pray to them.

140
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:42,579
We prey on them.

141
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:44,086
Whatever, dude.

142
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:46,590
The point is, Leonard's
got one and you don't.

143
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,597
Is this it?

144
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:51,604
It was inappropriate to discuss
Leonard and Penny's sex life

145
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,111
in front of Leonard and Penny.

146
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:56,616
Oh, good!

147
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,124
(sighs with relief)

148
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:59,627
Now I can eat.

149
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:05,640
(cricket chirping)

150
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:07,648
What's that?

151
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,153
Sounds like a cricket.
Hang on.

152
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:14,662
(cricket crping)

153
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,171
Based on the number
of chirps per minute

154
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:17,675
and the ambient temperature
in this room,

155
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,181
it is a snowy tree cricket.

156
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:23,689
Oh, give me a freakin' break.

157
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:25,695
How could you
possibly know that?

158
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:27,200
In 1890, Emile Dolbear

159
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:28,704
determined that there was

160
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:29,707
a fixed relationship
between the number

161
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,711
of chirps per minute
of the snowy tree cricket

162
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:33,216
and the ambient temperature.

163
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,720
A precise relationship
that is not present

164
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,724
with ordinary field crickets.

165
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:39,231
How do you know what the exact
temperature of the room is?

166
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:41,237
Under the terms of my roommate
agreement with Leonard,

167
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,741
I've had unilateral control
of the thermostat

168
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:45,747
ever since the sweaty night
of '06.

169
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:49,756
Okay, you were right about
wolverine and bone claws,

170
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:52,765
but you're wrong
about the cricket.

171
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,272
Howard, don't embarrass
yourself.

172
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,277
The science chirps for itself.

173
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,284
(chuckling):
Humorous word play.

174
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,792
No, no, not this time.

175
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,296
I know insects, my friend.

176
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,800
I spent many

177
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:06,304
childhood years
capturing them with nets,

178
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,309
putting them in glass jars,
sticking pins through them,

179
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,814
mounting them on corrugated
cardboard with Dymo labels

180
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:14,322
underneath, identifying
the genus and species.

181
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:16,330
In Latin.

182
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:21,842
Oh, dude, you are never
getting a shiksa goddess.

183
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,852
(cricket chirping)

184
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,858
Thatis a snowy tree cricket.

185
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,363
Oecanthus fultoni.

186
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:31,869
I was done with Latin
by fifth grade.

187
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:33,376
Okay, okay, tell you what.

188
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,381
I am willing to bet anything

189
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:36,385
that's an ordinary
field cricket.

190
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,890
I can't take your money.

191
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,395
What's the matter, you chicken?

192
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:43,401
I've always found that
an inappropriate slur.

193
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:44,907
Chickens are not, by nature,

194
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,910
at all timid.

195
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,414
In fact, when I was young,

196
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,917
my neighbor's chicken got loose

197
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,923
and chased me up the big elm
tree in front of our house.

198
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,434
.
Chickens can't climb trees

199
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:56,439
Thank God.

200
00:07:58,946 --> 00:07:59,947
Okay,

201
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,951
I believe a chicken
made you his bitch.

202
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,461
But the cricket thing,
I don't buy.

203
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:06,465
Bet me.

204
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,969
Fair enough.

205
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:10,975
What stakedo you propose?

206
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:14,982
I will put up my
Fantastic Four number 48,

207
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:16,491
first appearance
of Silver Surfer

208
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,996
against your Flash 123,

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,002
the classicFlash
of two worlds issue.

210
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:24,008
All right, you have a wager.

211
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:26,516
Hmm.
Great.

212
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,021
Now how are you going to
settle it, hmm?

213
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:30,026
There is no way
to determine the species

214
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,531
of the cricket
without examining it.

215
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:36,539
(cricket chirping)

216
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:40,050
(chirping continues)

217
00:08:40,056 --> 00:08:44,060
I wonder what the non-pathetic
people are doing tonight.

218
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,068
(cricket chirping)

219
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:58,100
More wine?
Hit me.

220
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:05,623
I don't see anything.

221
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:08,126
Shh!

222
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:12,135
(cricket chirping)

223
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,643
Hallway.

224
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:18,657
(groaning)

225
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,661
One at a time.

226
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,186
(deep growling)

227
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:33,697
What was that?

228
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,702
My stomach.

229
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:38,709
Indian food doesn't
agree with me.

230
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:43,220
Ironic, isn't it?

231
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:45,727
Shh!

232
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:46,732
(chirping resumes)

233
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,237
(whispering):
Elevator shaft.

234
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:53,246
(chirping)

235
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,753
Help me open it.

236
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:55,756
Are you crazy?

237
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:58,260
We can't go down an empty
elevator shaft.

238
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,266
Fine, if you don't
want to proceed,

239
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,270
then you forfeit the bet,

240
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:03,274
and I'll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.

241
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,782
Let's open her up.

242
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,793
Are you bothered that I can
so easily manipulate you?

243
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:12,299
Don't push me, Sheldon.

244
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,805
I may be small, but I took
kung fu when I was 13,

245
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,313
and I remember
a good deal of it.

246
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,819
Oh, really?

247
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:21,323
Well, I grew up
with an older brother

248
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,327
and a very contentious
twin sister.

249
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,833
And I believe I could
easily best you

250
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:27,337
in any physical confrontation--
be it noogies, swirlies

251
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,845
or the classic
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

252
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:36,358
Ooh, big talk from a man who
was once treed by a chicken.

253
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,877
(both chuckle)

254
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,391
What are we drinking now?

255
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:49,397
Peppermint schnapps.

256
00:10:50,403 --> 00:10:53,406
Why would you buy
peppermint schnapps?

257
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,413
Because I like peppermint,

258
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,419
and it's fun to say schnapps.

259
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,427
(both laugh)

260
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:03,434
Hey, Leonard?
What?

261
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,940
Schnapps.

262
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:07,946
Schnapps.

263
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,952
You're right
, that is fun.

264
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,964
Be careful.

265
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:16,970
SHELDON:
If I were not being careful,

266
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:19,977
your telling me to be careful
would not ke me careful.

267
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:23,487
(cricket chirping)

268
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:26,996
Stairwell.

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,002
SHELDON:
Uh-oh, flashlight went out.

270
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:31,508
I need some batteries.

271
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:33,514
Fellas?

272
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,525
Hello?

273
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,536
It's really dark down here.

274
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:45,546
(vomiting)

275
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:48,552
Oh, sweetie.

276
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:51,560
You really can't hold
your liquor, can you?

277
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:54,070
I'm okay.

278
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,573
Just a little mouthwash,

279
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:59,080
and then I'm gonna rock
your world.

280
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:04,597
(vomiting)

281
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,102
Are you okay?

282
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,203
Ugh, Toby, what did you do
in a past life

283
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:19,210
to be so disgusting now?

284
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,216
His name isn't Toby

285
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:23,721
Toby is an absurd name
for a cricket.

286
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:24,725
What would you name him?

287
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,229
An appropriate cricket name.

288
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,733
For example, Jiminy.

289
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,238
All right,

290
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,741
Sheldon, here we go.

291
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:34,246
Kleingast's Field Guide
to North American Insects.

292
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:35,750
Hey, Toby.

293
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:38,255
Right here.

294
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,260
See it?

295
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,262
The common field cricket,

296
00:12:40,264 --> 00:12:41,765
AKA Gryllus assimilis,

297
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,270
which is Latin
for "suck it, you lose."

298
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:46,275
Hang on.

299
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:47,779
Voil?.

300
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:49,283
The snowy tree cricket.

301
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:51,287
AKA Oecanthus fultoni,

302
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:53,791
which is Latin for
I'll suck nothing.

303
00:12:53,795 --> 00:12:54,796
Of course I'm joking

304
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:57,800
because the Latin for that
isnihil exsorbibo.

305
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,307
That is not Toby,

306
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,312
this is Toby.

307
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:02,814
Raj, what do
you think?

308
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,819
Oh, I really don't care anymore

309
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,829
God, I had the most
horrible night.

310
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,335
What happened?

311
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:14,340
Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the shiksi goddess.

312
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,847
Shiksa. Shik-sa.

313
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:18,352
Forgive me.

314
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:21,356
Yiddish was not spoken
in east Texas.

315
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,363
And if it was,
it wasn't spoken for long.

316
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:25,869
Yeah, fine, whatever.

317
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,872
The point is,
you're wrong again.

318
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,378
We haven't established
that I'm wrong once.
All right.

319
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:31,382
Tell you what.
Let's go down

320
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,885
to the Entomology
Department

321
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,389
and let Professor
Crley tell us

322
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:36,393
what kind of cricket
Toby is.

323
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:37,396
SHELDON:
He's a snow
y tree cricket,

324
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,400
and his name
is Jiminy.

325
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,405
I bet I could throw
a rock in this room

326
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,912
and come up
with three better friends.

327
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,434
Holy crap.

328
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:01,951
It's like Silence
of the Lambs down here.

329
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:04,460
(screams)

330
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:08,468
Don't do that!

331
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,473
You're such a girl.

332
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,476
They're just bugs.

333
00:14:11,478 --> 00:14:12,979
Yeah, well,
I don't like bugs, okay?

334
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:13,982
They freak me out.

335
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,486
Interesting.

336
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,989
You're afraid of
insects and women.

337
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:21,497
Ladybugs must render
you catatonic.

338
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:26,007
It was a joke.

339
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:28,514
I made it to lessen
your discomfort.

340
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,021
You're welcome

341
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:33,025
(footsteps)

342
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:37,538
(chuckling): Don't knock.

343
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,041
Just walk in.

344
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,545
Why be polite to the world's
leading expert

345
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,550
on the dung beetle?

346
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:45,556
Excuse me,

347
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:47,059
are you Professor Crawley?

348
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:49,063
Who wants to know?

349
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,570
I'm Dr. Cooper
from the Physics Department.

350
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:54,075
Couldn't wait, huh?

351
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:55,580
I'm sorry?

352
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:57,082
I haven't even packed yet,

353
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,086
and you're already
measuring my lab

354
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:02,092
for one of your godless
laser machines.

355
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,101
No, you don't understand.

356
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,106
We just want to ask you
a question.

357
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:10,111
Let me ask you one first.

358
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,117
What's a world renowned
entomologist

359
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,622
with a doctorate

360
00:15:13,624 --> 00:15:16,126
and 20 years of experience
to do with his life

361
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:19,633
when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

362
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:21,640
Ask rhetorical questions

363
00:15:21,643 --> 00:15:24,646
that make people
uncomfortable?

364
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,652
(sarcastic laugh)

365
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:29,156
What's your deal?

366
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,664
Are they planning to outsource
my job to Bangalore?

367
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,674
I'm from New Delhi.

368
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,681
Maybe you should find
another entomologist.

369
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:40,685
No, no. We're here.
Let's settle this.

370
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,690
Professor, can you identify
our cricket?

371
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,195
Of course I can.

372
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:48,701
I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

373
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:50,207
Not that
that's going

374
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:53,212
to keep me from having to move
in with my daughter in Oxnard.

375
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:54,719
And we're not talking

376
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,223
Oxnard at the beach. No!

377
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:58,728
We're talking
Oxnard

378
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,733
in the onion fields.

379
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:07,246
Well, could you
look at Toby?

380
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:08,751
Toby?

381
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:12,759
What a stupid name
for a cricket.

382
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,767
Told ya.

383
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,271
It's a field cricket.

384
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:18,274
Yes!
No, no, wait.

385
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,278
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

386
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,783
Young man, I've been
studying insects

387
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:24,287
since I was eight years old.

388
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:26,291
You know what
they used to call me

389
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:27,295
in school?

390
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:29,298
Creepy Crawley.

391
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,303
Cruel as that may be,

392
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,308
that is not in itself
a credential.

393
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:36,315
Let me show you something.

394
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:38,319
See that?

395
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:40,324
That's a Crawley's dung beetle

396
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,830
I discovered it after spending
six months slogging

397
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,835
through a Bornean rain forest,

398
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,341
while my wife
was back home

399
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,347
shacking up with a two-bit
ornithologist

400
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,352
who lives on a sailboat

401
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,858
and likes to wear
boot-cut jeans!

402
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,363
So, when I tell

403
00:16:57,367 --> 00:17:00,370
you that that's a common
field cricket,

404
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,378
you can take that
to the damn bank!

405
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,883
Cause God knows I can't

406
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:15,907
Well, apparently,
I was wrong.

407
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,913
Congratulations.

408
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,932
Enjoy Oxnard.

409
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,441
I'm sure your daughter's
looking forward to having you.

410
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:38,963
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

411
00:17:38,965 --> 00:17:40,967
What you got there?
A new comic book?

412
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,972
Old comic book.

413
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:45,977
I just retrieved it
from my safe deposit box.

414
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,985
What do you have a safe
deposit box for?

415
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:51,992
Old comic books.

416
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:53,998
I lost this
to Wolowitz

417
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,003
in an ill-considered
cricket wager.

418
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:00,010
What, do they have
Wii cricket now?

419
00:18:01,518 --> 00:18:03,520
That can't be very popular.

420
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:05,524
Penny, I'd rather
not talk about it.

421
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:07,029
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

422
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:08,533
I'm not feeling so hot either.

423
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,540
Why would that make
me feel better?

424
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:15,046
I don't know, empathy?

425
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,061
Anyway, I'm just saying,

426
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,066
that you're feeling upset
about something with Howard,

427
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,071
and I'm upset about something
with Leonard.
Yes,

428
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:27,075
yes, the disappointing
sex.

429
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,581
That's an inexac
t parallel.

430
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,587
You and Leonard can always
return to being friends,

431
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,092
whereas I can never
return to a state

432
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,097
in which Wolowitz
has not bested me

433
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:38,601
like Mrs. Riley'
s chicken.

434
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:41,108
What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?

435
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:44,114
A chicken that was owned
by Mrs. Riley.

436
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,621
Okay, forget the chicken.

437
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,127
Well, I wish I could.

438
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,132
No, no.

439
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:52,636
You may be right
about me and Leonard.

440
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:54,140
Of course I'm right

441
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:57,145
What are the odds I'd be
wrong twice in one week?

442
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,151
No, I mean, we can always go
back to being friends.

443
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:01,155
I just said that.

444
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:02,659
This conversation has
started to circle.

445
00:19:02,661 --> 00:19:05,164
Meeting adjourned.

446
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:09,676
Hello.

447
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:10,679
Hey.

448
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,184
What's going on?

449
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:14,688
Oh, you'd like to catch up

450
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:16,692
on the events of the
day. All right.

451
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:19,197
Well, there was a half-hour wait
at the bank

452
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,701
to get into my safe deposit box,

453
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,206
I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems,

454
00:19:23,711 --> 00:19:24,712
and, oh, yes,

455
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,715
in a moment filled
with biblical resonance,

456
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:28,720
pride wenteth before my fall,

457
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:32,727
causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.

458
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:34,234
Wait a minute.

459
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,738
You talked to Penny
about our sex life?

460
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:38,243
Leonard, it astonishes me

461
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,248
how you continually fixate
on the trivial.

462
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:43,254
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

463
00:19:43,257 --> 00:19:44,758
Right, right.

464
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,262
You're saying you talked
to Penny?

465
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:47,765
Ye-Yes.

466
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:48,268
Interesting.

467
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,271
Hardly.

468
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,274
Excuse me.

469
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:53,778
Have I crossed some
sort of line again?

470
00:19:53,781 --> 00:19:55,783
Little bit.

471
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,789
Hmm.

472
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,802
Ah, who cares?

473
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,702
Oh, hey.
Hey.

474
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:12,673
Uh, what did Sheldon
say to you?

475
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,651
Not a lot.

476
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:15,136
Just that we always
have the option

477
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,115
of going back
to being friends.

478
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,085
Is that what you want?

479
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:20,556
I don't know.

480
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,034
I mean, you have to admit

481
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:25,014
things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

482
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,469
I guess.

483
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,448
It would take
the pressure off.

484
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,419
It would, wouldn't it?

485
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,875
So, we'll just be friends.

486
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:34,837
Good.

487
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:36,323
Good.

488
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,302
Come here.
Hmm.

489
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,302
Okay-dokey
